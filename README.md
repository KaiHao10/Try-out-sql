# The Analysis
I just wanna try how to quote my code here. Let's do it!
```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    job_posted_date,
    salary_year_avg,
    name as company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
left join company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Machine Learning Engineer' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_hour_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
